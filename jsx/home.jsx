          <p>
            I was born to do one thing but, I haven't been able to find a way to get paid sitting on the couch and binge watching Netflix. So, I decided to start studying Frontend Web Development. If you ask my family, they will tell you how technically savvy I am. I don't think I would be bragging to much if I said I am the go to guy when they need someone to hook up their printers. If the word of my family isn't enough keep reading and I might surprise you.
